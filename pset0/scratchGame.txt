Below is a link to my scratch game created for problem set 0 of week 0 in CS50x.  
It is a space shmup(ish) game which allows the player to move their rocket ship 
from side to side via the 'A' and 'D' keys. The player presses 'Space' to fire
at evil space jellyfools which appear at random spots at the top of the screen and
work their way to the bottom in an attempt to break through the player's defense.
If too many evil space jellyfools get by the player then the game is lost.  If the
player kills all 50 jellyfools on the attack then the game is won.
